Handling real-time data with WebSockets in React applications.

///Hookes 
useState

Manages state in functional components.
useEffect

Performs side effects such as data fetching or subscriptions.
useContext

Accesses context values without passing props.
useReducer

Manages complex state logic using actions and reducers (alternative to useState).
useCallback

Memoizes callback functions to avoid unnecessary re-creations on re-renders.
useMemo

Memoizes expensive calculations to optimize performance.
useRef

Creates mutable references that persist across re-renders (e.g., DOM references).
useImperativeHandle

Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using ref in functional components.
useLayoutEffect

Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.
useDebugValue

Displays a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.

//Redux 
1. Store
Centralized place to hold the application's state.
The only source of truth for the app's state.
2. Actions
Plain JavaScript objects that describe an event or action in the application.
Must have a type property, which describes the action.
Can also carry a payload property to pass data.
3. Action Creators
Functions that return action objects.
Simplify dispatching actions by creating reusable functions.
4. Reducers
Pure functions that specify how the state should change in response to an action.
Takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.
5. Dispatch
A function used to send actions to the Redux store.
Triggers state updates via the reducer.
6. Getters (Selectors)
Functions that access or derive specific parts of the state.
Helps in reading state data efficiently.
7. combineReducers
A helper function that combines multiple reducers into a single reducer.
Useful for managing different pieces of the application's state.
8. applyMiddleware
Enhances the store with additional functionality (e.g., logging, handling async actions).
Common middleware includes Redux Thunk and Redux Saga.
9. Middleware
Functions that allow you to intercept and modify the action before it reaches the reducer.
Common middleware includes Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, and Redux Logger.
10. Redux Thunk
Middleware for handling asynchronous actions.
Allows action creators to return functions (instead of just actions), enabling async logic like fetching data.
11. Redux Toolkit
A modern, official library for efficient Redux development.
Provides tools like createSlice, createAsyncThunk, and the configureStore method to simplify Redux usage.
12. createSlice
A Redux Toolkit method that combines reducers and actions into one function for more concise code.
13. createAsyncThunk
A Redux Toolkit method for handling async actions.
Automatically dispatches pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions for async operations.
14. Provider
A React component that makes the Redux store available to the rest of the application.
Wraps the root component in the application.
15. useDispatch
A React-Redux hook that returns the dispatch function, allowing components to dispatch actions.
16. useSelector
A React-Redux hook that allows components to select pieces of state from the Redux store.
17. Normalized State
A pattern in which the state is structured in a flat format (using entities and IDs) to simplify data management, especially with relationships between objects (e.g., a list of users and their associated posts).
